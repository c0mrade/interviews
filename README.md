# Interviews

Welcome to this repository, which collects a wide range of interview questions and solutions from various sources, not just personal experiences. Each directory is named after an interview task, curated from either direct experiences or submissions from community.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to share interview questions and provide solutions that help in understanding and mastering common programming challenges. This platform encourages contributions from everyone, aiming to create a diverse and educational environment. Please note, to uphold integrity, we do not include company names related to the interview questions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed and valued! Whether you are adding new questions, solutions in your favorite programming language, or improving existing content, your input helps everyone learn. Please ensure that your submissions are well-documented and adhere to the repository’s structure for clarity and accessibility.

## Usage

Explore the repository to find various programming challenges and their solutions. Each directory offers insights into different approaches for solving interview tasks, reflecting the diversity in problem-solving in programming.

## Adding a New Question

To maintain consistency and ease of navigation, please follow the repository structure when adding a new question. Each problem should be organized into directories as follows:

### Example:

For a problem named ["in-memory-file-system"](./in-memory-file-system/) the structure looks like this:

```
in-memory-file-system/
├── README.md  (contains the problem statement)
└── solutions/
    └── ruby/
        └── 01/
            └── solution.rb
```

### Structure Breakdown:

1. **problem-name**: The directory named after the interview question or problem.
2. **solutions**: A subdirectory that contains all possible solutions.
3. **programming-language**: A directory for the programming language used in the solution (e.g., `ruby`, `python`, `javascript`).
4. **solution-number**: If there are multiple solutions in the same language, number them sequentially (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.).

Each solution directory should include the necessary code files and any supporting documentation. While there are no strict guidelines for code format or the inclusion of tests and documentation, providing well-structured, clearly commented code is highly encouraged. Well-documented solutions not only help others understand your approach but also offer valuable insights into your thought process and problem-solving techniques.

## Note

This repository is strictly for educational and learning purposes. It is not intended to facilitate cheating in interviews. It is a resource for practice and learning how to tackle common problems faced during technical interviews.

Thank you for contributing, learning, and sharing your knowledge. Happy coding!
