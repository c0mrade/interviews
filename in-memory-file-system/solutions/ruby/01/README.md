## Info about solution

When I was asked this question at an interview, I managed to wrap up `mkdir` and `ls` functionality and wasn't able to even write tests for it, I ran out of time. The solution isn't perfect or optimal but it's what I went with at an interview. I implemented the rest in my free time, I didn't spend too much time thinkig about a more optimal approach, instead I just added the missing functionality.

What I'm trying to say is that sometimes interviews don't go your way, due to various reasons. Like one reason being this particular problem is not something most of the developers do on a day to day basis, and most (including myself) under estimate the problem.
